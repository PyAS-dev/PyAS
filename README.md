# Python Algebra System (PyAS)

**PyAS** is a modular Python-based algebra and calculus toolkit built on top of [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/).  
It provides a user-friendly interface for solving equations, performing calculus operations, and evaluating mathematical functions—perfect for students, educators, and developers.
